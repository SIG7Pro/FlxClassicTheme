// Flixel Classic Theme //

 # About
/ This is a project meant to emulate the look (and possibly feel) of legacy Windows.
/ Legacy Windows in the sense of Windows 95/98, or the Classic Theme provided in Windows Vista and Windows 7. (Not the internal Classic theme from Windows 8.0 and up, which is just Windows V/7 Basic.)
/ One could also compare this to Wine's "No Theme" look, which makes sense.
/ The name is likely going to be a placeholder if I can find a better name for it.

 # To Do
- Add the look of Windows in a HaxeFlixel project. (High Priority)
- Replace/Modify the HaxeFlixel Startup screen. (Low Priority)
- Find a way to lower the HaxeFlixel Startup Jingle (Medium-High Priority)

 # Progress

- Inserted custom cursors. (1:33-34 PM.)
- First Build (Linux Build Tested on Zorin OS 17{?}, 1:49 PM.)
- Finished writing the first draft of this Readme file. (5.4 KB / 1:59 PM.)
